# A simple HTTP API for interacting with systemd service manager and adjacent daemons.

Basically it's an API to manipulate Linux needed for my very WIP administration panel for Linux - Dragon Panel!

## Testing

API tests are done using k6. All tests for the whole daemon are packaged in one file.\
Just cd into `tests` dir and run `k6 run script.js`.
